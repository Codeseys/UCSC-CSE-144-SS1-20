11:13:28	 From  Varun Balusu : I forgot to clarify this but does anyone know what the difference between this:
11:13:32	 From  Varun Balusu : y=θ0+θ1x+θ2x2+...+θdxd
11:13:44	 From  Varun Balusu : And this y=θ0+θ1x1+θ2x22+...+θdxdd
11:14:00	 From  Varun Balusu : Like one has the subscripts and the other does not
11:19:59	 From  Baladithya Balamurugan : I try to abide by subscript to identify the features of the data pt and the superscript to identify the index of the collection of data pts
11:20:46	 From  Chidvi Doddi  to  Baladithya Balamurugan(Privately) : Lol were you answering a questiom
11:20:49	 From  Chidvi Doddi  to  Baladithya Balamurugan(Privately) : I joined late

11:21:30	 From  Chidvi Doddi  to  Baladithya Balamurugan(Privately) : Ohh cool
11:21:34	 From  Baladithya Balamurugan  to  Chidvi Doddi(Privately) : hell to the fuk no
11:21:39	 From  Chidvi Doddi  to  Baladithya Balamurugan(Privately) : :(
11:21:51	 From  Baladithya Balamurugan  to  Chidvi Doddi(Privately) : i dont even know what type of q is today
11:21:56	 From  Chidvi Doddi  to  Baladithya Balamurugan(Privately) : ikr
11:22:02	 From  Chidvi Doddi  to  Baladithya Balamurugan(Privately) : Its prob the same format
11:22:06	 From  Chidvi Doddi  to  Baladithya Balamurugan(Privately) : Cause she likes doing that
11:22:30	 From  Baladithya Balamurugan  to  Chidvi Doddi(Privately) : like are we doing theoretical only or is a littl bit of vector calcs in there?
11:24:38	 From  Chidvi Doddi  to  Baladithya Balamurugan(Privately) : Theoretical mostly I think
11:24:44	 From  Chidvi Doddi  to  Baladithya Balamurugan(Privately) : She’s prob gonna pull from the pmts
11:24:48	 From  Chidvi Doddi  to  Baladithya Balamurugan(Privately) : ppts*
11:24:57	 From  Chidvi Doddi  to  Baladithya Balamurugan(Privately) : Cause we aren’t coding on the test
11:26:48	 From  Baladithya Balamurugan  to  Chidvi Doddi(Privately) : hoping that we aren't coding
11:43:46	 From  Baladithya Balamurugan  to  Chidvi Doddi(Privately) : why do i feel somewhat terrified
11:44:58	 From  Chidvi Doddi  to  Baladithya Balamurugan(Privately) : rip
11:45:03	 From  Chidvi Doddi  to  Baladithya Balamurugan(Privately) : Lol same
12:03:33	 From  Baladithya Balamurugan : for q8 are we to assume the matrix X has a column of 1's? for the bias term
12:07:40	 From  Michael Covarrubias : Matrix X includes bias term
12:08:02	 From  Baladithya Balamurugan : ty
12:11:08	 From  radomyrbezghin : Accidentally submitted quiz =(
12:13:02	 From  Sukhveer Karlcut : For question 11 does explain the significance of each term mean explain each variable?
12:14:13	 From  Narges Norouzi : each term in the cost function and factors
12:14:24	 From  Sukhveer Karlcut : thanks
12:23:00	 From  Baladithya Balamurugan : is q7 asking about a non-linear and complex model from a data set or a non-linear and complex dataset
12:23:39	 From  Narges Norouzi : what do you mean by a non-linear dataset?
12:23:51	 From  Narges Norouzi : I think the question is clear
12:24:23	 From  Baladithya Balamurugan : i was assuming model but on the off chance its talking about a data set with a high variance
12:24:36	 From  Baladithya Balamurugan : just want to clarify that's all
12:25:46	 From  Michael Briden : as the question states: train a non-linear and complex (in both the geometric and algebraic sense) model
12:26:17	 From  Shishir Kapoor : Can we quit the zoom session if we have submitted the quiz?
12:26:25	 From  Vipul Gupta : ^
12:26:31	 From  Michael Covarrubias : Yes
12:26:37	 From  Vipul Gupta : Ok thanks
12:26:39	 From  Shishir Kapoor : Cool. Thanks
12:30:03	 From  Chidvi Doddi  to  Baladithya Balamurugan(Privately) : Bruh that was hell
12:30:06	 From  Baladithya Balamurugan  to  Chidvi Doddi(Privately) : ikr
